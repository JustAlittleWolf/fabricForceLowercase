# Fabric Force Lowercase

This mod forces the first argument of any command to be sent as lowercase to the server to prevent syntax issues

It does this by forcing characters that are typed in the first word out after the / to be written as lowercase.
Example:

`/Msg TestUser My message! -> /msg TestUser My message!`
